# Zig implementation for wc
This is a basic implementation for the challenge `build your own wc` from [Coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/).

It's bare minimal but it works.

It's my first project in Zig so don't expect the best and optimized code. I think it's pretty decent for a simple project like this one.

## How to run
You will need to have al least Zig` 0.13.0` installed.

A simple `zig build-exe main.zig` will work for compiling the proyect.

Any suggestions and improvements are welcome!
