# Zig coding challenges
I will be implementing challenges from the [Coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/) website in Zig.

My goal is to learn Zig as I write these programs and hope helping others in doing so.

Any help, suggestion or improvements are welcome!

Good luck!
